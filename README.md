# RackNerd VPS Deals 2026: From $11.29/Year, Promo Codes Inside

So I've been poking around the budget VPS space for a while, and RackNerd keeps coming up. Not because they're throwing money at ads, but because people on hosting forums genuinely can't stop talking about them. Founded in 2019 by industry veteran Dustin B. Cisneros, the company has quietly grown into an Inc. 5000 company running 21 data centers across three continents. That's not a small operation.

The pitch is simple: enterprise-grade infrastructure without the enterprise-grade price tag. And in 2026, they're still delivering on that.

## What's Actually Happening With RackNerd Prices Right Now

Their New Year 2026 sale is still live as of this writing, and the numbers are genuinely hard to argue with. We're talking KVM VPS — not the janky OpenVZ kind where your neighbor's traffic surge tanks your server — starting at **$11.29 per year**. That works out to less than a dollar a month for a real virtual private server with dedicated resources, SSD storage, and full root access.

## Dedicated Servers — If You Need The Whole Machine

Not everyone needs a VPS. If you're running a busy database, rendering jobs, or just hate resource contention on principle, RackNerd also does bare metal. These are provisioned within 24–72 hours and come with IPMI access.

| Server | Specs | Bandwidth | IPs | Location | Price/Month | Order |
|--------|-------|-----------|-----|----------|-------------|-------|
| Intel Xeon E3-1240 V3 | 4x 3.40 GHz, 32 GB RAM, 1 TB SSD + 3 TB HDD | Unmetered 1Gbps | /28 (13 usable) | New York | **$64.95/mo** |  [Order Now](https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&pid=908&aff=13961) |
| AMD Ryzen 7600 | 6x 3.80 GHz, 64 GB RAM, 1 TB NVMe | Unmetered 1Gbps | /30 (1 IP) | Utah | **$109.95/mo** |  [Order Now](https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&pid=909&aff=13961) |
| Dual Xeon E5-2683 v4 | 32x 2.10 GHz, 256 GB RAM, 2x 2 TB SSD | Unmetered 1Gbps | /27 (29 usable) | New York | **$209.00/mo** |  [Order Now](https://my.racknerd.com/cart.php?a=add&pid=910&aff=13961) |

Use code `15OFFDEDI` to shave 15% off dedicated servers for life. That turns the E3-1240 into about $55/month — not bad for an unmetered 1Gbps box with 13 IPs.

## What OS Can You Run?

For Linux VPS, they support CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, Fedora, Debian, and Ubuntu out of the box. Need something custom? Open a support ticket after ordering and they'll sort it out.

Windows VPS is available too, powered by AMD Ryzen 3900X with NVMe storage. Windows Server 2012 and 2016 are both options — includes full Administrator access and RDP. Use `WIN-30OFF` for a 30% lifetime discount there.

## The Support Thing

A lot of hosts claim 24/7 support and then you open a ticket and hear back two days later. RackNerd's average ticket response time is reportedly under 10 minutes. That's the kind of claim that either gets you loyal customers or angry ones — and the general consensus across hosting forums leans toward the former.

## Who Should Actually Use RackNerd?

Developers running side projects, people self-hosting apps, small businesses with a WordPress site or two, anyone learning Linux server administration — RackNerd is a solid fit. They're not positioning themselves as a managed cloud platform and they're not pretending to be. It's infrastructure, it works, and it's genuinely cheap.

If you're an enterprise running mission-critical workloads and need hand-holding with SLAs written in blood, look elsewhere. But for everyone else?
